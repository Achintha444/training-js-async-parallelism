## üíù Thanks

This repository was created using an algorithm developed by [Arnaud Buchholz](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz), you can find more information about it in the [training-js-async-parallelism](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/training-js-async-parallelism) repository.

## üçÅ Overview

How to deal with a **large** amount of **asynchronous operations** in a **controlled** way.

The typical use case is when you have a variable number of requests to send to a server but you want to avoid stressing the server or to be blocked by a rate limiter.

## üîÅ What is different from the original algorithm 

In the original algorithm, [Arnaud Buchholz](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz) uses only the main thread to execute the operations, using parallel executions. 

But in this repository, I used the **workers** to execute the operations, which allows to use multiple threads and to execute the operations in parallel, while using the same principal of the parallel executions for the main thread.

## Results of the benchmark





## üñ•Ô∏è How to demo

* Clone and `npm install`
* Use `npm test` to start `vitest`.

This repository was created using [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html).
